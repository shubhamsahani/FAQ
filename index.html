				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q.2 What is the AQI in India?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>Air Quality Index or AQI is a universally applied method to measure the Air Quality and Pollution of the air and share it with the people. This is generally calculated by air monitor and an air pollutant concentration. It can be signified by a colour group and its ranges of health risks caused.
				The pollution sources in India - and in most asian countries - are numerous and incompletely understood. In Delhi, for example, it comes mostly from light and heavy duty vehicle traffic emissions, road dust, solid fuel combustion for heating and cooking, biomass, waste burning, thermal power plants, diesel generators, construction and small-scale local industries. That’s why each country has to have their own AQI values.
				The National Air Quality Index Standard (NAQI) in India was launched by The Minister for Environment, Forests & Climate Change, Shri Prakash Javadekar, on 17 September 2014. The initiative constitutes part of the Government’s mission to introduce the “culture of cleanliness”, as the air pollution has been a huge concern in the country, especially in urban areas. The National Air Monitoring Program (NAMP), that covers 240 cities in the country, has been operated by the  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and developed by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT), providing data in public domain, on real time basis. You can access it by clicking here.
				To understand how the AQI works, you just have to know the six range categories (Good, Satisfactory, Moderately Polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe) and check the associated health impacts. Solutions should be taken based on the AQI Category and the pollutant associated to it, as follows:</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q.3 What causes Air Pollution?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>Industries, agriculture and traffic, as well as energy generation are the main sources of air pollution. During combustion processes and other production processes air pollutants are emitted. Some of these substances are not directly damaging to air quality, but will form harmful air pollutants by reactions with other substances that are present in air. Examples of large-scale air pollutants are VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) and small dust particles. When large concentrations of these substances are emitted this negatively affects ecosystems, materials and public health. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) mainly stem from agriculture, because nitrogen in soils can easily be denitrified by bacteria. Nitrous oxide is emitted during the denitrification process. Additionally, the application of (artificial) fertilizers causes emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and methane CH4), a greenhouse gas. The agricultural sector is known for its extensive use of pesticides. This is the reason for a lot of emissions of many toxic chemicals.
				The amount of traffic is responsible for one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions caused by traffic are mainly those of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, VOC and small dust particles.
				Humans are also partly responsible for air pollution. Firstly because the products they use have caused air pollution during their production and distribution and secondly because heating of houses and offices causes chemicals released into the air. When people use paints or cosmetics VOC is released and perspiration, pet fertilizer use and cleanser use cause ammonia emissions. Last but not least, many chemicals (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide) are emitted during smoking.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q.4 PM2.5 always higher than PM10? Why?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>Even though by definition, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers are concluded in PM2.5 and thus, should be included as smaller as 10 micrometers.
				The concentration of PM2.5 even though is smaller than the concentration of PM10, still the cumulative AQI value can be higher because of PM2.5, just like the AQI level of 50 would be 15.5 mg/m3, whereas the AQI level would have 55 mg/m3 for PM10.
				So in this context, even if the whole 15.5mg/m3 of PM2.5 are added to PM10, then also the concentration of PM10 will be much lower than PM2.5 AQI. The PM2.5 concentration was 366, resulting in 216 AQI, while the PM2.5 was 348, resulting in 398 AQI.
				The reason why PM10 is calculated?
				So why do we still need to have PM10 measurement, when we are doing PM2.5? That is because the fraction of PM2.5 is higher in the PM10 fraction, for the most cities with pollution from transport and other combustion sources, an often neglected non-combustion source is dust resuspension (from road dust and dust storms), which forms part of the coarser fraction (PM2.5 to PM10). If we quit measuring PM10, we will be neglecting this source.
				Also, a lot of cities in China and Delhi still measure the pollution in cities by measuring PM10, that is also one of the reasons why PM10 is calculated.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q.5 (a) What is the great smog of Delhi and where does it come from?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>The term Smog is derived from the combination of smoke and fog. It is a kind of Air Pollution. This was derived from the odour, colour of the smoky fog that has been developing. The smog is generally composed of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ozone, smoke or particulates among others (less visible pollutants include carbon monoxide, CFCs and radioactive sources).
				Human created smog is released during the combustion of fossil fuels in our vehicles, power plants, factory boilers and homes. They are also released by industrial processes, the evaporation of liquid fuels and the use of solvents and other volatile products such as oil-based paints. There are also certain natural sources that create Smog such as trees, bogs, and volcanic activity.
				The smog has been occurring beyond the AQI level in Delhi due to rise in the levels of PM2.5 and PM10.The Great Smog also has been occurring due to delay of public transports like metros, buses, trains and flights.
				The main cause of smog is primarily due to colder weather, stagnant winds trapping the various sources of smoke. The main causes of formation of smoke is due to stubble burning, lit garbage, road dust, power plants, factories and vehicles.
				The measure of smog can be measured by checking the Air Quality Index of the area and also by measuring the PM2.5 and PM10 as they are the major pollutants causing air pollution, where the AQI Levels reaching to a whooping 406 “severe” level in October and November after the causing of Diwali.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q.5 (b) What is Ozone and its main two issues?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
			<p>Ozone is a natural gas which is composed of three atoms of Oxygen. It is typically blue in colour and has a very distinct strong odour.
			It is divided into two different issues i.e. Stratospheric Ozone Depletion and Ground-Level Ozone Formation.

			Stratospheric Ozone Depletion

			Ozone is generally present in the Stratospheric Environment, which typically is 10-50 kilometres over the Earth’s Surface. The ozone layer protects all life from ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun. But still there are several chemicals used in air conditioning and certain industrial uses damage the ozone layer, allowing more UV to reach the Earth's surface. Since UV causes skin cancer, cataracts, and other harmful effects ozone depletion will lead to increases in these problems. Increased UV can also lead to reduced crop yield and disruptions in the marine food chain.

			2.  Ground-Level Ozone Formation
			This gas is typically found in the Troposphere which is the layer forming the current atmosphere.It is subsequently formed by human actions causing the chemical reaction between gases. It ranges from 0-10 kilometres causing serious air pollution. The same ozone molecules that protect us from UV high in the stratosphere can cause health problems for people and animals when they form near the Earth's surface. Ground-level ozone is formed when vehicle exhaust and some other chemicals commonly used in industry mix in strong sunlight. When these ozone concentrations get high enough, they can make breathing difficult, especially for people with asthma and other respiratory diseases

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Mobile sources produces air pollution from exhaust emissions, as well as evaporative emissions and refueling losses from gasoline engines are derived from mobile sources. Combustion of fuels can cause the release of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter (PM), toxics, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Pollution also depends on different types and amounts of it with many factors: the type of engine or vehicle (e.g., passenger car, heavy-duty truck, lawn mower, locomotive, etc.) the type of fuel used (e.g. gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels), the type and condition of emission control devices (e.g. catalytic converters) and how the engine is used/run. Just like diesel engines used in trucks, buses, locomotives, and ships tend to emit more NOx and PM than gasoline engines. Engines with catalytic converters (e.g. passenger cars) emit much less HC, CO, NOx, and toxics than similar engines without catalysts (i.e., the catalytic converter is an important pollution control device to reduce exhaust emissions).</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>By continuous checking of the Air Quality Health Index on a regular basis to find out what the health risks from air pollution, you can check the well being of your and your family’s health. We can protect our health by appropriately changing our behaviour to reduce our exposure to air pollutants when air quality gets worse.
				When the Air Quality Health Index reading rises, you can decide whether you or someone in your family needs to:
				Reduce or reschedule outdoor physical activities
				Monitor possible symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, coughing or irritated eyes
				Follow a doctor’s advice to manage existing conditions such as heart or lung disease.

Particulate matter 2.5 is a pollutant particle which is so fine that it is not visible to the naked eye. The Diameter of this particle matter is 2.5 which is literally 30 times smaller than one hair strand. PM2.5 is tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. Outdoor PM2.5 levels are most likely to be elevated on days with little or no wind or air mixing. The term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and one-half microns or less in width.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
			<p>Acid rain is not just what is called as acid deposition, it can also be snow and fog or gas and dust. Acid deposition mainly forms during fossil fuel combustion. When emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides come in contact with water, they will become sulphuric acid and nitric acid.
			Agents such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ammonia, end up in plants, surface water and soils, there are various consequences like:
			- Availability of nutrients and metal spores is likely to decrease.
			-Metals dissolve more due to high acidity in water. This can cause surface water to become polluted, which has serious health effects on aquatic plants and animals. For example, high aluminium (al) concentrations can complicate nutrients uptake by plants. This makes aluminum one of the prior causes of forest decay. Mercury can be dispersed by transport through surface water, causing it to accumulate in fish. Mercury can biomagnify up the food chain, to be taken up by humans eventually.
			- Erosion damages buildings and monuments. Sulphur dioxide breaks down limestone by reacting with calcium carbonate, causing limestone to absorb water during rainfall. Limestone will then fragment.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q. 24 Difference between ambient air pollution and outdoor air pollution?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Ambient air pollution is a broader term used to describe air pollution in outdoor environments. Poor ambient air quality occurs when pollutants reach high enough concentrations to affect human health and/or the environment. Outdoor air pollution is a more specific term referring to the ambient air pollution experienced by populations living in urban areas, typically in or around cities.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q. 25 How can you reduce air pollution at home?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>These are the few methods by which we can reduce the amount of pollution at home:
				Getting water-based or low solvent paints, varnishes, glues and wood preservatives
				Avoid burning solid fuels if possible
				Burn only authorised smokeless fuels (your local authority can provide further advice)
				Avoid lighting bonfires. If you must do so, don't light them when pollution levels are high or while the weather is still and cold. Only burn dry material and never burn household waste, especially plastic, rubber, foam or paint.
